categorize te# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ChatbotBase.js:219 - Document Count API Error (500 Status)

**Problem:** 
- The ChatbotBase component was trying to connect to `http://localhost:3060` but the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- This caused a 500 error when trying to fetch document counts

**Solution:**
- Fixed the API base URL in `client/src/components/chatbots/base/ChatbotBase.js`
- Changed from hardcoded `http://localhost:3060` to use the correct default `http://localhost:3000`
- Removed duplicate function declaration that was causing TypeScript errors

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/chatbots/base/ChatbotBase.js`

### 2. ModalProvider.js:125 - Modal Type "UpsertFileModal" Not Found

**Problem:**
- The ModalProvider was looking for exact modal key matches
- Legacy code was trying to open "UpsertFileModal" but the registry contains "00435-02-UpsertFileModal"
- This caused modal rendering failures

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the ModalProvider with intelligent modal key matching
- Added fallback logic to handle partial and suffix matching
- Now supports both exact matches and legacy modal key patterns

**Matching Strategy:**
1. Exact match in management modals
2. Exact match in generated registry
3. Partial matching (key contains modalType or vice versa)
4. Suffix matching (e.g., "UpsertFileModal" matches "00435-02-UpsertFileModal")
5. Enhanced error logging with available keys

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/modal/context/00170-ModalProvider.js`

## Technical Details

### ChatbotBase Fix
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const apiBaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3060';

// After (correct)
const apiBaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

### ModalProvider Enhancement
```javascript
// Added intelligent matching logic
const suffixMatch = modalKeys.find(key => key.endsWith(modalType));
if (suffixMatch) {
  console.log(`[ModalProvider] Found suffix match for "${modalType}": using "${suffixMatch}"`);
  return generatedModalRegistry[suffixMatch];
}
```

## Expected Results

1. **ChatbotBase:** Document count API calls should now succeed and display correct document counts
2. **ModalProvider:** Modal opening should work for both exact keys and legacy modal names
3. **Error Logging:** Better debugging information when modals are not found

## File Verification

The modal file `client/src/pages/00435-contracts-post-award/components/modals/00435-02-UpsertFileModal.js` exists and is properly implemented. The issue was not a missing file, but the modal key matching logic in the ModalProvider.

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Document Count:** Open any page with chatbots and verify document counts load without 500 errors
2. **Modal Opening:** Try opening modals using both exact keys ("00435-02-UpsertFileModal") and legacy names ("UpsertFileModal")
3. **Console Logs:** Check browser console for improved error messages and successful modal matching logs

## Modal Registry Status

The generated modal registry (`client/src/generated/modalRegistry.js`) contains 48 modals including:
- `00435-02-UpsertFileModal` (the file that was causing the error)
- All other contract-related modals
- Management modals for various disciplines

## Backward Compatibility

Both fixes maintain backward compatibility:
- ChatbotBase still respects `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable
- ModalProvider supports both new prefixed modal keys and legacy modal names
- Existing code calling `openModal("UpsertFileModal")` will now work by finding `"00435-02-UpsertFileModal"`
